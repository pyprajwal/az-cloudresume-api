            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>
                An aspiring IT Engineer with a strong focus on Azure Cloud and Microsoft technologies, I have honed my skills by working with employers in both the US and Australia. My career has been marked by a commitment to leveraging cloud services, automation, and IT infrastructure management to deliver optimized solutions. I have accomplished projects in deploying and managing Azure resources, utilizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Bicep and Azure CLI to streamline operations.
            
                I bring a broad set of skills, including system management, network administration, and providing exceptional end-user support. Working across diverse teams and cultures has allowed me to develop excellent communication skills, enabling me to coordinate effectively with international colleagues and stakeholders.
            
                My interest spans the Azure ecosystem, from automating user onboarding processes to managing cloud environments, ensuring business continuity, and improving operational efficiency. I am passionate about driving transformation through Microsoft technologies and am always excited about new opportunities to learn, innovate, and contribute to impactful projects in the IT space.
